I used chatGPT as my LLM.
Motivation to use LLM, was because of lack of time since leaving too little time to do the exercise, 
but still wanted to do it for learning purposes.
LLM helped with getting the grasp of networking and correcting some small mistakes I did in Dockerfiles/compose.yaml
LLM frequently tried using functions that gave errors in for example getting the IP, so in those cases using google to find correct
functions was way easier.
LLM was not able to provide 100% efficient code, so it mostly just showed me towards a path that could solve my problems,
but in the end I ususally needed to fix the errors myself.
